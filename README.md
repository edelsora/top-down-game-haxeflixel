## Haxeflixel x LDtk

This a game example build using Haxeflixel and LDtk, not final example but at last working.

TODO:

- [ ] Load collision layer effectivly without touching assets.
- [ ] Collision shape for player sprite.
- [ ] Point system.
- [ ] Better menu.

### LDtk Configuration

1. In this example I use super simple export mode.
2. For making collision layer use Integer Grid Layer, and load graphic file that used as tileset for the map.
    - See [PlayState.hx at line 21](./source/states/PlayState.hx)
